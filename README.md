# Game of commit

Web app that allows you to challenge someone to a game of a commit. The game
works as follows. You and the person you are playing with both commit to keeping
a certain standard in terms of code commits on Github. The specifics are up to
you - maybe you want to commit every single day, or want to precommit to writing
good git commit messages.

At the web interface, you login with Github and find someone you want to
challenge. Rules are set by the challenger, and once the other person accepts
your challenge, you will both get an email with the other person's daily
commits. The game is based on an honor system, so who loses first is a matter of
consensus. The game has now started. You can also see progress in the app itself.
